# Refactoring Engine: Edits, Plans, and Validation

This document explains how Shopware Language Server changes source code. Every
edit — a one-token quick fix, a cross-file rename, a scaffolded new class —
flows through the same three stages: resolve an element in an immutable
snapshot, compile byte edits, validate the result before the editor sees it.

The core is [`internal/rewrite`](../internal/rewrite), with language-aware
helpers in [`internal/php/rewrite`](../internal/php/rewrite) and callers in
`internal/lsp/{inspections,codeaction,refactor,scaffold}`.

## The central rule

> **Nothing mutates a syntax tree.**

A CST is a lossless view of one exact source snapshot. Changing source means:

1. resolve the element you want to change **in that snapshot**;
2. compile the change to byte edits **against that snapshot**;
3. hand the edits to the client as a workspace edit.

The package doc states it plainly:

```go
// Package rewrite builds validated, lossless source edits from immutable CST
// elements. It deliberately does not mutate syntax trees: callers resolve an
// element in one document snapshot and compile the requested change to byte
// edits for that same snapshot.
```

Two consequences follow, and both are load-bearing:

- **A rewrite is only valid for the snapshot it was built against.** If the
  document changed, the rewrite is stale and must be rejected, not adapted. That
  is what [`ElementHandle`](#element-handles) enforces.
- **The server never writes files.** It returns a `protocol.WorkspaceEdit`. The
  editor, the CLI, and MCP each apply it through their own path, and all three
  get the same validation.

## Edits

```go
// internal/rewrite/rewrite.go
type Edit struct {
    Range   cst.TextRange   // byte offsets into the snapshot
    NewText string
    order   int             // declaration order, for insertion coalescing
}
```

An `Edit` is a byte-range replacement. Insertion is a zero-width range;
deletion is an empty `NewText`. There is no "insert node" or "wrap in
parentheses" operation — everything reduces to replacing bytes, which is what
makes losslessness trivially preserved: bytes you did not touch are unchanged,
including formatting and comments.

## Builder and conflict rules

```go
builder := rewrite.NewBuilder(document.Source)

builder.Replace(element, "newText")     // element.Range() ← text
builder.Delete(element)                 // element.Range() ← ""
builder.InsertBefore(element, "text")   // at element.Range().Start
builder.InsertAfter(element, "text")    // at element.Range().End
builder.Insert(offset, "text")          // zero-width at offset
builder.ReplaceRange(rng, "text")       // explicit range

edits, err := builder.Finish()
```

Every method funnels into `ReplaceRange`, which validates the range against the
snapshot length and returns `ErrInvalidRange` for an inverted or out-of-bounds
range. Passing a nil element is also `ErrInvalidRange` rather than a panic.

`Finish()` does three things:

**1. Sorts** by start, then end, then declaration order — stably.

**2. Coalesces insertions at the same offset** in declaration order:

```go
if previous.Range.Start == previous.Range.End &&
    edit.Range.Start == edit.Range.End &&
    previous.Range.Start == edit.Range.Start {
    previous.NewText += edit.NewText
    continue
}
```

So two `InsertBefore` calls on the same element produce the text in the order
you wrote them, not an overlap error. This is what makes composing independent
rewrites work — adding a `use` declaration and adding an attribute at the same
offset simply concatenate.

**3. Rejects overlaps** with `ErrOverlap`. `editsConflict` treats a zero-width
insertion as conflicting only when it lands *strictly inside* another edit's
range — touching a boundary is fine:

```go
func editsConflict(left, right Edit) bool {
    if left.Range.Start == left.Range.End {
        return left.Range.Start > right.Range.Start && left.Range.Start < right.Range.End
    }
    if right.Range.Start == right.Range.End {
        return right.Range.Start > left.Range.Start && right.Range.Start < left.Range.End
    }
    return left.Range.Start < right.Range.End && right.Range.Start < left.Range.End
}
```

An insertion at the start or end of a replaced range is therefore legal, while
an insertion in the middle of text that is being replaced is an error — the
result would be undefined.

## Applying edits

```go
func Apply(source string, edits []Edit) (string, error)
```

`Apply` re-validates through a fresh `Builder` (so it cannot be handed
unvalidated edits) and then applies them **back to front**:

```go
for index := len(validated) - 1; index >= 0; index-- {
    edit := validated[index]
    result = result[:edit.Range.Start] + edit.NewText + result[edit.Range.End:]
}
```

Descending order means earlier offsets stay valid as later ones are rewritten —
no offset bookkeeping, no shift accumulation. The input snapshot is never
mutated.

## Document and workspace plans

```go
type DocumentPlan struct {
    URI       string
    Version   *int          // nil = versionless (a freshly created file)
    Source    string        // the snapshot the edits were built against
    LineIndex *cst.LineIndex
    Edits     []Edit
}

func NewDocumentPlan(uri string, version *int, source string, edits []Edit) DocumentPlan
func (p DocumentPlan) Apply() (string, error)
```

A `DocumentPlan` carries the snapshot alongside the edits. That is what lets the
server verify, at apply time, that the document has not changed — and what lets
tests apply a plan without a server.

```go
type WorkspacePlan struct {
    Documents []DocumentPlan
    Creates   []CreateFilePlan
    Deletes   []DeleteFilePlan
}

type CreateFilePlan struct { URI, Content string }
type DeleteFilePlan struct { URI string; Version *int; Source string }
```

`WorkspaceEdit()` compiles the plan into `protocol.DocumentChanges` in a fixed
order — **creates, then document edits, then deletes** — because a document edit
may target a file the same plan creates. A create becomes a
`CreateFileOperation` with `Overwrite: false, IgnoreIfExists: false` (so an
unexpected existing file is an error, not a silent clobber), followed by a
versionless text edit inserting the content.

A URI may appear only once across all three sections; a duplicate is an error
rather than an ambiguous merge.

Byte ranges become UTF-16 protocol ranges here, using the plan's line index.
This is the only place in the rewrite pipeline that knows about UTF-16.

## Element handles

A quick fix is presented, sent to the client, and possibly resolved and applied
many keystrokes later. A CST pointer cannot survive that, and a byte range alone
is not enough — the document may have changed underneath it.

```go
// internal/rewrite/handle.go
type ElementHandle struct {
    URI      string
    Version  int
    Language language.ID
    Kind     cst.Kind
    Range    cst.TextRange
    TextHash uint64 `json:"textHash,string"`   // FNV-1a of the element text
}
```

`Resolve` re-finds the element and refuses anything that does not match exactly:

```go
func (h ElementHandle) Resolve(uri string, version int, languageID language.ID, tree *cst.Tree) (cst.Element, error) {
    if h.URI != uri || h.Version != version || h.Language != languageID {
        return nil, ErrStaleHandle
    }
    if tree == nil || tree.Root == nil || h.Range.Start > h.Range.End ||
        h.Range.End > tree.Root.Range().End {
        return nil, ErrMissingHandle
    }
    candidate := tree.Root.DescendantForRange(h.Range)
    for candidate != nil {
        if candidate.Kind() == h.Kind && candidate.Range() == h.Range &&
            hashText(candidate.Text()) == h.TextHash {
            return candidate, nil
        }
        candidate = candidate.Parent()
    }
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("%w: %s kind %s", ErrStaleHandle, h.Range, h.Kind)
}
```

Six checks: URI, version, language, kind, exact range, text hash. The walk up
from `DescendantForRange` handles the case where the anchored element is not the
innermost element at that range.

`TextHash` is serialized as a JSON **string** deliberately: JavaScript clients
cannot represent every `uint64` in a JSON number without rounding, and a
silently rounded hash would defeat the check.

Callers turn the two error types into user-facing reasons:

| Error | Meaning | Typical message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ErrStaleHandle` | The document changed | "The document changed; request code actions again" |
| `ErrMissingHandle` | No element to anchor to | "The quick fix could not be prepared" |

## Validation

`Server.validateWorkspacePlan` runs before **any** plan becomes a
`WorkspaceEdit`. Four checks, per section.

**Created files** must be inside the workspace root, must not already exist, and
must parse without errors:

```go
if _, err := os.Stat(path); err == nil || !errors.Is(err, os.ErrNotExist) {
    return fmt.Errorf("created document %q already exists or cannot be checked", created.URI)
}
if _, result, parsed := s.documentManager.languages.ParsePath(created.URI, created.Content); parsed && len(result.Errors) != 0 {
    return fmt.Errorf("created document has %d parser errors", len(result.Errors))
}
```

**Edited documents** must still match the snapshot, and applying the edit must
not make the syntax worse:

```go
if current.Document.Source != planned.Source || !sameOptionalVersion(current.Version, planned.Version) {
    return rewrite.ErrStaleHandle
}
updated, err := planned.Apply()
_, result, parsed := s.documentManager.languages.ParsePath(planned.URI, updated)
if parsed && len(result.Errors) > len(current.Document.ParseErrors) {
    return fmt.Errorf("rewrite introduces %d parser errors", len(result.Errors)-len(current.Document.ParseErrors))
}
```

The comparison is against the document's **existing** error count, not zero. A
fix must be able to apply inside an already-broken file — that is often exactly
when you need it — but it must not add new syntax errors. This one check catches
most malformed-rewrite bugs before a user ever sees them.

**Deleted files** must exist as regular files and must match the recorded
snapshot and version.

**Cancellation** is checked between every item.

When validation fails the code action is returned **disabled with a reason**
rather than dropped or shipped:

```go
action.Disabled = &protocol.CodeActionDisabled{Reason: "The generated edit is no longer valid"}
action.Edit = nil
```

A disabled action with a reason is good UX; a broken edit is not.

## Worked example: a quick fix

Replacing a deprecated Vue I18n `$tc` call with `$t`, complete:

```go
// internal/lsp/inspections/admin_i18n.go
func (adminI18nTCFix) Build(
    _ context.Context,
    fixContext lsp.FixContext,
) (rewrite.WorkspacePlan, error) {
    // 1. decode the payload the analyzer bound when it reported the problem
    payload, err := lsp.DecodeBoundFixPayload[adminI18nTCReplacement](fixContext)
    if err != nil {
        return rewrite.WorkspacePlan{}, err
    }
    if payload.Replacement != "$t" {
        return rewrite.WorkspacePlan{}, fmt.Errorf("invalid Vue I18n replacement")
    }

    // 2. resolve the anchor against the CURRENT tree
    element, err := fixContext.Anchor.Resolve(
        fixContext.Document.URI,
        fixContext.Document.Version,
        fixContext.Document.SyntaxLanguage,
        fixContext.Document.SyntaxTree,
    )
    if err != nil {
        return rewrite.WorkspacePlan{}, err
    }

    // 3. re-verify the assumption the fix depends on
    if element.Text() != "$tc" {
        return rewrite.WorkspacePlan{}, rewrite.ErrStaleHandle
    }

    // 4. compile edits against this snapshot
    builder := rewrite.NewBuilder(fixContext.Document.Source)
    if err := builder.Replace(element, payload.Replacement); err != nil {
        return rewrite.WorkspacePlan{}, err
    }
    edits, err := builder.Finish()
    if err != nil {
        return rewrite.WorkspacePlan{}, err
    }

    // 5. return a versioned plan
    version := fixContext.Document.Version
    return rewrite.WorkspacePlan{Documents: []rewrite.DocumentPlan{
        rewrite.NewDocumentPlan(
            fixContext.Document.URI, &version, fixContext.Document.Source, edits,
        ),
    }}, nil
}
```

Step 3 is the one people skip. `ElementHandle.Resolve` proves the *element* is
unchanged, but a fix usually also depends on a *semantic* assumption. Re-check
it and return `ErrStaleHandle` if it no longer holds — that turns a wrong edit
into a graceful "request code actions again".

Also note: **always pass the version.** A versioned document edit lets the
editor reject the change if the buffer moved between response and application.
Omit it only for files the same plan creates.

## Language-aware rewrites: the PHP editor

Byte edits are the right primitive, but "add an interface to this class" should
not be written by hand at every call site. `internal/php/rewrite` provides a
composable editor over the PHP CST:

```go
// internal/php/rewrite/editor.go
editor := phprewrite.NewEditor(source, root)
// ... schedule several related changes ...
edits, err := editor.Finish()
```

Available operations:

| Area | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| Imports and references | `ClassReference(className)` |
| Class shape | `SetExtends`, `RemoveExtends`, `AddImplements`, `RemoveImplements`, `AddAttribute` |
| Members | `InsertClassMember`, `RemoveClassMember` |
| Lists | `InsertArgument`, `AppendArgument`, `RemoveArgument`, `InsertParameter`, `AppendParameter`, `RemoveParameter` |
| Types | `SetParameterType`, `SetPropertyType`, `SetReturnType` |
| PHPDoc | `FindPHPDocAnnotation` and related helpers |
| Raw | `ReplaceRange`, `Insert`, `Delete` |

Two of these deserve highlighting because they encode judgment you would
otherwise re-derive:

**`ClassReference(className)`** returns the shortest unambiguous reference to a
class *and* schedules a `use` declaration when one is useful. If an existing
alias would conflict, it falls back to a fully-qualified reference rather than
rewriting someone's imports:

```go
// ClassReference returns the shortest unambiguous reference to className and
// schedules a use declaration when one is useful. Conflicting aliases fall
// back to a fully-qualified reference rather than changing existing imports.
```

**`InsertClassMember`** inserts before the closing brace and re-indents every
non-empty line to match the surrounding class body, so generated members do not
arrive with the generator's indentation.

Both compose: schedule an import, an attribute, and a member, then `Finish()`
once. The insertion-coalescing rule in `Builder` is what makes several
independent operations at the same offset behave.

When you need a Twig, XML, or YAML rewrite, use `rewrite.Builder` directly with
ranges from that language's `query` package. Only PHP currently has enough
recurring rewrite shapes to justify a dedicated editor.

## Rename

`textDocument/rename` uses **first-match** dispatch, not fan-out:

```go
// internal/lsp/rename.go
for _, provider := range s.renameProviders {
    edit, err := provider.Rename(ctx, request)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("rename provider %T: %w", provider, err)
    }
    if edit != nil {
        return edit, nil          // first provider that answers wins
    }
}
return nil, nil
```

That differs from completion and definition deliberately: concatenating two
providers' rename edits would produce a conflicting or double-applied refactor.
A rename provider must therefore be confident about ownership — return `nil`
unless the symbol under the cursor is clearly yours.

Rename providers live in `internal/lsp/refactor`:

- `php_twig_rename.go` — a PHP symbol whose name also appears in Twig
- `twig_template_rename.go` — template paths and block names
- `admin_rename.go` — Administration components and their references

Cross-language rename is exactly why rewrite plans are workspace-scoped:
renaming a Twig block touches every template that extends or overrides it, and
all of those edits must land as one workspace edit or none.

## File rename

`workspace/willRenameFiles` lets the server update references *before* the
editor moves a file:

```go
// internal/lsp/file_rename.go
type FileRenameRequest struct {
    *protocol.RenameFilesParams
    Documents []*TextDocument      // every open document
}

type FileRenameProvider interface {
    WillRenameFiles(context.Context, *FileRenameRequest) (*protocol.WorkspaceEdit, error)
}
```

Unlike symbol rename this **is** a fan-out: every provider contributes, and
their `Changes` maps are merged per URI. Different providers own different
reference kinds — a moved Twig template affects `extends`/`include` paths, a
moved PHP class affects imports — and those are independent.

The request carries all open documents because unsaved buffers must be updated
too, not just indexed files.

## Scaffolding

`internal/lsp/scaffold` generates new code — entities, plugins, DAL
definitions, Administration components. It uses the same machinery:
`CreateFilePlan` for new files, `DocumentPlan` for registration edits in
existing files, one `WorkspacePlan` for the whole operation.

The validation rules apply unchanged: created files must be inside the root,
must not exist, and must parse. A scaffold that generates syntactically invalid
code is caught before the editor applies it.

## Commands instead of edits

Some workflows genuinely cannot be an edit — they need user input, editor
snippet semantics, or a multi-step interaction. Those implement
`CommandQuickFix` instead:

```go
type CommandQuickFix interface {
    QuickFix
    BuildCommand(context.Context, FixContext) (*protocol.CommandAction, error)
}
```

**Prefer edits.** A workspace edit works in every client. A command only works
in a client that implements it, and the server filters out actions whose
commands the client did not advertise — MCP in particular can apply workspace
edits but cannot execute editor-only commands. See
[`lsp-server.md`](lsp-server.md#gating-features-domains-client-profiles).

Also: **code actions must never write files directly.** Returning a workspace
edit is what lets the editor, the CLI (`codeaction -exec`), and MCP validate and
apply the change consistently — and what makes `codeaction` able to preview a
unified diff without touching the disk.

## Design rules

1. **Never mutate a tree.** Resolve, compile, return.
2. **One snapshot per plan.** Every edit in a `DocumentPlan` must be built
   against that plan's `Source`.
3. **Always carry the version** for edits to existing documents.
4. **Resolve the anchor, then re-verify the semantic assumption.** A matching
   element is not proof that the fix still applies.
5. **Prefer `RewriteQuickFix` over `CommandQuickFix`.**
6. **Prefer lazy resolution** (`FixLazy`) for non-trivial or cross-file
   rewrites, so element handles get a chance to reject a stale document instead
   of computing an edit nobody asked for.
7. **Compose through one builder or editor.** Do not concatenate strings and
   hope the offsets line up; let `Finish()` catch the conflict.
8. **Return a reason, not a broken edit.** If the rewrite cannot be produced
   safely, fail — the caller turns that into a disabled action with an
   explanation.
9. **Reuse analyzers and rewrite helpers across migrations.** For
   version-migration inspections in particular, prefer a shared analyzer over
   copying one Rector rule verbatim into each inspection.

## Testing

Test a rewrite at three levels.

**The edit itself** — apply the plan and compare source:

```go
plan, err := fix.Build(context.Background(), fixContext)
require.NoError(t, err)
require.Len(t, plan.Documents, 1)

updated, err := plan.Documents[0].Apply()
require.NoError(t, err)
require.Equal(t, expectedSource, updated)
```

**Staleness** — build the fix against one document version, then resolve against
a newer one and assert `ErrStaleHandle`. This is the regression that matters
most, because it only manifests as a corrupted file in production.

**Protocol shape** — a server-level test that the action is offered, that
`codeAction/resolve` produces the edit for a lazy fix, and that the ranges are
correct UTF-16. Use a real `TextDocument` so the conversion is actually
exercised; a hand-built range skips the most error-prone step.

Also assert the **validation** path: a fix that would introduce parser errors
must be rejected. `internal/rewrite/rewrite_test.go` covers builder conflicts,
coalescing, and `Apply`; `internal/php/rewrite/*_test.go` covers the PHP editor
operations; `internal/lsp/codeaction` and `internal/lsp/inspections` cover
presentation and end-to-end fix behavior.

```bash
go test ./internal/rewrite ./internal/php/rewrite
go test ./internal/lsp/inspections ./internal/lsp/codeaction ./internal/lsp/refactor
shopware-lsp -root /path/to/project codeaction -kind quickfix src/Controller.php:24:18
shopware-lsp -root /path/to/project rename -d src/Controller.php:24:18 NewName
```

The last two print a unified diff without writing, which is the fastest way to
eyeball a rewrite against a real project.

## Interactive Twig and snippet commands

The Storefront Twig block extension and snippet creation commands return an
`edit` containing a validated workspace edit. They resolve open target documents
before disk, retain document versions, and build all changes before returning.
Snippet discovery only suggests paths; it never creates files. The VS Code
client checks target versions again immediately before applying the returned edit
and retains compatibility with older custom
servers that apply the command themselves and return no edit.

Command adapters live in `internal/lsp/commands`; domain indexes expose plain Go
APIs. The same server snapshot resolver and plan validator serve these commands
and rewrite quick fixes.

### Snapshot validation for action adapters

Inspection actions recheck the effective diagnostic policy when listed and when
resolved. Disabling a rule, inspection, domain, or client presentation removes
its cached fixes as well. Document resolution checks workspace containment
before consulting open buffers.

Legacy text-edit providers pass through the same workspace-plan validator. The
server adds open-document versions and source fingerprints; resolving an action
rejects changed targets, including closed files changed on disk. New resource
operations belong in typed rewrite fixes or command plans.

Administration Twig overrides return one validated workspace edit for the
component script, template, and entry point. Translation extraction lists locale
targets first, then builds the final plan after selection, using the unchanged
source document and the latest target snapshots. Missing-translation diagnostics
bind indexed locale metadata without reading or parsing resource files; only the
selected fix computes an insertion. Existing keys in unsaved targets are rejected.
