# Symfony Plugin Feature Roadmap

This roadmap maps the user-facing features in
`idea-php-symfony2-plugin` onto portable Language Server Protocol
capabilities. IntelliJ PSI, gutter, tool-window, and action implementations are
treated as design references; indexes and framework knowledge stay independent
of a particular editor.

## Current coverage

| Domain | LSP coverage |
|---|---|
| Dependency injection | XML, YAML, fluent/array PHP configurator, attributes, and typed-container references; persistent PHP-array parameters, explicit services, aliases, defaults, conditional tags, deprecations, effective autowire state, and PSR-4 prototypes plus structural completion/navigation/diagnostics for arguments, calls, factories, classes, tags, parents, and decorators; service, alias, parameter, tag, class, and container-constant completion/navigation; persistent PHPDoc `#Service` and `#Parameter` contracts provide exact container-name completion and definition navigation for matching function, constructor, and inherited method call arguments; exact YAML service-option completion for block/flow definitions and `_instanceof` rules with duplicate filtering, legacy marking, scalar keywords, standard/config tags, and Composer-version-aware DI argument tags; inherited public-method completion and declaration navigation for YAML calls/tag callbacks/modern or legacy factories and XML calls/factories, with exact edits and receiver-aware validation; `AutowireLocator`, `AutowireServiceClosure`, `AutowireMethodOf`, and `AutowireCallable` service intelligence plus public-instance callable-method completion/navigation through service aliases or `::class`; tag completion/navigation for PHP `tagged_iterator()` / `tagged_locator()` and `TaggedIterator`, `TaggedLocator`, `Autoconfigure`, and `AutoconfigureTag`; typed `ParameterBagInterface`/`ContainerBagInterface` `get()` and `has()` parameter completion/navigation/missing diagnostics with service-container disambiguation; missing-reference and local duplicate diagnostics; global/inherited class/enum constant resolution with modern/legacy YAML syntax and missing diagnostics; deprecated service/class completion marking and hint diagnostics from source or compiled-container metadata; legacy factory-setting diagnostics; conventional XML/YAML service-tag class/interface contract diagnostics with modern/legacy alternatives plus inheritance-aware actions that add missing inferred tags while preserving block/flow syntax; constructor-argument validation and insertion actions plus position/name-aware XML argument rewrites for every type-compatible explicit, prototype, or compiled service; XML/YAML positional constructor/configured-method argument inlay hints with inherited PHP parameter/type resolution; undefined `$this->property` service-injection actions with name/method-ranked type candidates, inherited-property suppression, import management, optional-parameter ordering, and promoted/traditional/readonly constructor-style preservation; interactive YAML/XML/PHP service-definition generation from PHP classes with inferred constructor/setter services and tags; interactive compiler-pass creation for bundle classes with import-aware `build()` registration and atomic new-file workspace edits; YAML named-argument completion, PHP parameter navigation, invalid-key diagnostics, and typo actions with inherited-constructor support plus name-only/typed `_defaults.bind` navigation across explicit and prototype services; configured XML/YAML service-method existence validation with typo and cross-file create-method actions; constructor and configured-method service-reference type validation across XML/YAML/PHP configurator and legacy-array syntax with interface/inheritance/union relations, unsaved local definitions, and syntax-preserving compatible-service fixes; compiled-container fallback; PHP type inference; persistent PHP/XML/YAML PSR-4 prototype expansion; PHP class-to-definition and effective-autowire constructor code lenses; cross-format forward/reverse decorator and parent code lenses plus prototype-to-class navigation; structured service location by exact ID or class with alias/class resolution, metadata, explicit/prototype/compiled provenance, bounded source previews, exact locations, cache restore, and a searchable editor navigator |

PHPDoc assistant contracts from the plugin's `DocHashTagReferenceContributor`
are persisted in the PHP semantic graph. `#Route`, `#Service`, `#Parameter`,
`#Class`, `#Interface`, `#ClassInterface`, `#Entity`, `#FormType`, and
`#Template` provide exact completion and definition navigation at function,
constructor, and inherited method call arguments. `#TranslationKey` and
`#TranslationDomain` additionally correlate named or positional sibling
arguments, with `messages` as the default key domain. Every assistant contract
also participates in domain-aware missing-reference diagnostics and exact typo
replacement actions; class-family diagnostics preserve the tag's class versus
interface kind constraint.

## Planned ports

### 1. Symfony reference validation

- Missing asset, service, parameter, class, alias-target, and Twig template
  diagnostics are implemented.
- Deprecated services and their PHP classes are marked in completion and
  diagnosed across PHP, XML, and YAML references, including optional
  references and compiled-container `<deprecated>` metadata.
- Create-definition code actions. Route/template/service/parameter/class typo
  suggestions and replacement actions are implemented.
- Cross-file duplicate analysis. Document-local duplicate route, service, and
  parameter diagnostics are implemented.
- Controller target and method validation is implemented for YAML, XML, and
  static Twig `controller()` references, including class/route-service
  completion, definition, hover, persistent Find References, bidirectional
  PHP/Twig code lenses, and a create-method action (with route placeholders
  where available).
- Required constructor argument validation is implemented for XML and YAML
  services, including typed service suggestions and insertion actions. Existing
  XML argument slots also offer one rewrite per type-compatible service,
  preserving named-argument metadata.
- Undefined `$this->property` references inside indexed service classes offer
  ranked constructor-injection rewrites, preserving the class's promoted or
  traditional injection style and PHP language level.
- YAML named constructor arguments have completion, PHP parameter navigation,
  exact invalid-key diagnostics, and typo replacement actions, including
  inherited constructors and incomplete `$name` completion contexts.
- Service references supplied to constructors and configured method calls are
  validated against PHP parameter types across XML, YAML, PHP configurator
  `args()`/`arg()`, and legacy PHP `arguments` arrays, including interfaces,
  inheritance, nullable/unions, aliases, unsaved local definitions, and
  syntax-preserving compatible-service replacement actions.
- Conventional XML/YAML service tags are checked against their required class
  or interface contracts, including alternative modern/legacy Twig APIs.
  Contextual XML/YAML rewrite actions infer and insert absent conventional tags
  from the configured class hierarchy.
- Symfony container constants in XML and modern/legacy YAML syntax have
  completion, PHP definition navigation, and missing-reference diagnostics for
  global constants, inherited class constants, and enum cases.

### 2. Twig and translation intelligence

- Typed Twig globals from YAML configuration, PHP extensions, and the compiled
  container are implemented. Infer additional event-subscriber variables.
- Twig `{% types %}` declarations are implemented with optional variables,
  escaped PHP class completion/navigation, persistent PHP references, direct
  and loop-element member inference, and typed `if`/`for` suggestions shared
  with `@var` declarations.
- Twig `@var` comments expose semantic keyword, variable, and type tokens for
  both declaration orders, unions, array types, and multiple declarations.
- Twig `@see` documentation comments resolve PHP classes/methods, controller
  service actions, logical templates, and workspace-relative files, with
  class/method/template completion and legacy bare-target compatibility.
- Template usage references and safe file move/rename support are implemented
  for static Twig tags/functions, PHP render APIs, and explicit
  `#[Template]` mappings. Dynamic template expressions remain
  intentionally excluded.
- Standalone static PHP strings ending in `.twig` provide the reference
  plugin's exact-template definition fallback without becoming indexed usages
  or rename targets.
- Related-item code lenses cover reverse template references, direct extending
  templates, same-name overrides, ancestor blocks, and transitive block
  implementations, with unsaved `extends` and block declarations overlaid.
- PHP `renderBlock()` and `renderBlockView()` block-name intelligence is
  implemented for `AbstractController` subclasses, including inherited block
  declarations, named arguments, typo diagnostics, and quick fixes.
- Include/embed parameter intelligence, macro signatures/imported-call
  intelligence, and Symfony UX Twig Component names, props, variables, and
  blocks are implemented.
- Deprecated PHP fields/getter methods in Twig accessors are detected from
  PHPDoc and `#[Deprecated]`, including members reached through typed variables
  and Twig function/filter return types.
- Modern and legacy Twig token-parser tags are persisted with custom-tag
  completion and PHP navigation. PHPDoc, `#[Deprecated]`, and parse-time
  `trigger_deprecation()` metadata produces hint diagnostics on opening and
  conventional `end…` closing tags.
- Symfony UX lifecycle/PHP-attribute completion (`ExposeInTemplate`,
  `PreMount`, `PostMount`, `LiveProp`, `LiveAction`, `LiveListener`,
  `LiveArg`, and hydration/rerender hooks), custom exposed names, writable
  Live props, and the `computed.*` getter proxy are implemented.
- Live Action names and `#[LiveArg]` arguments are implemented across helper
  hashes and modifier-aware data attributes, including completion, navigation,
  hover, diagnostics, typo actions, and persistent action references.
- Static Live Component emitted events and `#[LiveListener]` payload arguments
  are implemented across PHP and Twig, including scoped emit variants,
  repeatable and inherited listeners, `#[LiveArg]` aliases, completion,
  navigation, hover, diagnostics, typo actions, and persistent cross-language
  event references.
- Controller-backed Twig `FormView` child completion, definition, hover, and
  missing-field diagnostics are implemented from persistent form-type
  provenance. `form.vars.*` metadata is also persisted from direct and
  `array_replace()` assignments in type/core/extension `buildView()` and
  `finishView()` methods.

### 3. Symfony framework APIs

- HttpClient `request()` / `withOptions()` option completion and declaration
  navigation are implemented from persisted typed constant-array metadata,
  with duplicate-key filtering and option default hover.
- Console helper completion, class navigation, and hover are implemented for
  typed helper-set/command calls from persisted literal helper-name returns.
- Console declaration run markers are implemented as current-document code
  lenses. The VS Code client launches the canonical command as a process task
  through the workspace `bin/console`, avoiding shell interpolation and
  supporting a configurable PHP executable.
- The persistent command catalog is exposed through a structured language
  server request and powers `Symfony: Run Console Command…`, the portable
  equivalent of the plugin's Run Anything provider. Catalog entries include
  aliases, implementation targets, arguments, options, exact file URIs, and
  project-relative paths for other clients; text and Ant-style source-file
  filters match the plugin's machine-readable collector.
- Dotenv/Docker/Compose declarations and `%env(...)%` completion, navigation,
  references, processor-aware hover, cache restore, and stale removal are
  implemented. Runtime-only variables intentionally do not produce missing
  diagnostics.
- Composer-version-aware selection between legacy and modern SecurityBundle
  schemas, plus enum/value completion. The implemented nested YAML schema
  follows SecurityBundle 7.4, while generic PHP config-root
  completion/navigation and imported-resource navigation come from persisted
  `ConfigurationInterface` tree signatures.
- Serializer metadata-group support and validation mapping-file schemas.

### 4. Doctrine

- Native SQL/native-query strings and dynamically assembled DQL expressions;
  static standalone DQL strings in `$dql`, typed `createQuery()`, and
  `setDQL()` contexts are implemented.
- Assigned and unassigned/fluent ORM QueryBuilder chains, nested `Expr`
  methods, right joins, and `indexBy` fields are implemented.
- Built-in DQL functions are discovered from Doctrine ORM's parser registry
  and provide completion, implementation navigation, and hover.
- Custom Doctrine type names from literal and class-constant-backed
  `getName()` returns, static DoctrineBundle YAML/XML `dbal.types` aliases,
  PHP `extension('doctrine', …)` registrations with string/imported
  `::class`/expanded class values, static `Type::addType()` /
  `Type::overrideType()` and type-registry registrations, mapping-manager
  scoping, and conventional class-name fallback are implemented.
  Configuration-schema completion, generated fluent configuration builders,
  and dynamically constructed/injected registry registrations remain.
- Legacy ORM/ODM namespace maps from compiled containers and convention-based
  bundle fallbacks resolve `Bundle:Model` consistently in repository APIs,
  DQL, QueryBuilder, completion, definitions, diagnostics, and PHP result
  inference.
- Typed object-manager `find()` calls return the requested mapped model, and
  `getRepository()` returns a configured custom repository class when present
  while retaining Doctrine result and magic-finder inference.
- Incomplete XML mappings recover semantic contexts from empty model,
  repository, property, target, embedded-class, enum, lifecycle, and type
  attributes, and root ODM `embedded-document`/`embedded` declarations are
  indexed as embeddable models.
- Mapped PHP property metadata preserves namespace-resolved nullable, union,
  intersection, and parenthesized DNF types; the native PHP parser recognizes
  DNF-typed property declarations losslessly.
- MongoDB ODM PHP reference/embed attributes and annotations resolve
  `targetDocument` alongside ORM `targetEntity`/`class`, so untyped document
  properties retain exact target ranges and metadata.
- Discriminator maps are implemented across PHP attributes, legacy
  annotations, XML, and YAML with subtype-aware completion, definition, hover,
  missing/invalid diagnostics, typo actions, and reference navigation. Table
  indexes and unique constraints are implemented across PHP attributes/legacy
  annotations, XML, and YAML with field/column completion, definition, hover,
  diagnostics, typo suggestions, Find References, and analytics counts. Named
  queries, second-level cache configuration, and advanced ODM mapping options
  remain.
- Portable related-file code lenses between PHP models and external mappings
  are implemented, including reverse mapping-to-class navigation and typed
  repository-call model targets.

### 5. Assets and frontend tooling

- Named Symfony/Shopware asset package discovery and package-aware resolution
  are implemented for Twig and typed PHP, including bundle and dynamic theme
  paths.
- AssetMapper/importmap entrypoint metadata and Twig references are implemented,
  including installed-module target resolution and cache restore.
- Static asset completion/navigation in ordinary Twig stylesheet, script, and
  image attributes is implemented, including automatic `asset()` insertion,
  hover, cross-style references, and low-noise typo diagnostics.
- Stimulus controller discovery and Twig/HTML intelligence are implemented for
  conventional JS/TS files, explicit registrations, and `controllers.json`.
- Symfony Vite entrypoint indexing and Twig helper intelligence are implemented
  for direct, variable, and spread-based Rollup inputs, including navigation
  between config declarations, target files, and persistent Twig usages.
- Legacy Assetic named assets and `{% stylesheets %}`/`{% javascripts %}` tags
  are implemented, including native parsing, direct bundle/directory/glob
  operands, compiled-container formula reloads, completion, definition,
  references, hover, diagnostics, and typo actions.

### 6. LSP-native navigation surfaces

- Workspace symbols are implemented for services, container parameters, routes
  and concrete route URL matches, conventional and route-backed controller
  actions, commands, templates, Twig
  blocks/macros/extensions, Doctrine entities/tables, Twig/Live Components,
  translation domains, and translation keys.
- The plugin's service-locator collector is implemented as a structured
  language-server request accepting an exact service ID or PHP class. It
  resolves aliases and inherited classes, returns matching service IDs with
  tags/autowire/deprecation/parent/decorator metadata, distinguishes explicit,
  PSR-4 prototype, and compiled origins, and includes bounded source previews
  with exact locations; `Symfony: Locate Service…` provides the editor surface.
- The plugin's generated service-definition collector is implemented as a
  structured multi-class request over the existing YAML/XML/PHP-fluent/
  PHP-array generator. It returns per-class errors without discarding valid
  definitions and exposes every ambiguous constructor/setter parameter with up
  to 15 type-compatible service IDs, also appending format-correct suggestion
  comments; `Symfony: Generate Service Definitions…` opens the combined output.
- The plugin's machine-readable route collector is implemented as a structured
  language-server analytics request with route-name, controller, partial/full
  URL, and Ant-style controller-file filters. It returns normalized methods,
  declaration/controller locations, resolved service actions, and templates;
  `Symfony: Browse Routes…` provides the interactive editor surface.
- The plugin's profiler-request collector is implemented for local Symfony
  profiler storage. It discovers modern and legacy cache indexes, safely reads
  bounded raw or gzip profile blobs, supports URL/hash/controller/route
  filters, and correlates request metadata with controller source, static and
  runtime Twig templates, entry views, root form types, rendered Symfony UX
  Twig Components, and sent-mail subjects. `Symfony: Browse Profiler
  Requests…` navigates runtime components to indexed PHP classes or anonymous
  templates and opens matching mail panels only after an explicit user
  selection; HTTP profiler fetching is intentionally excluded so analytics
  never perform workspace-triggered network requests.
- The plugin's Doctrine entity and field collectors are implemented as
  structured language-server analytics requests. Entity results support text,
  kind, and Ant-style source-file filters; field results include inherited and
  flattened embedded paths, mapping/PHP/enum/relation types, declaring classes,
  and exact source locations. `Symfony: Browse Doctrine Entities…` provides
  the interactive editor surface.
- The plugin's form-type and form-option collectors are implemented as
  structured language-server analytics requests. Type results expose every
  class and legacy/container alias with parent/data-class relationships and
  effective option, field, and view-variable counts; option results merge
  inherited and extension declarations while retaining every declaration kind,
  default, allowed type, source class, and exact source location. `Symfony:
  Browse Form Types…` provides the type-to-option editor navigator.
- The plugin's Twig extension collector is implemented as a structured
  language-server analytics request with partial-name and type filters. It
  returns functions, filters, tests, and token-parser tags with callback
  classes/methods, typed optional parameters, usage signatures, deprecations,
  and source locations; `Symfony: Browse Twig Extensions…` provides the
  interactive editor surface.
- The plugin's Twig template-usage collector is implemented as a structured
  language-server analytics request with partial logical-name, project-relative
  path, and Ant-style target-file filters. It correlates physical templates,
  controller actions and routes, include/embed/extends/import/use/form-theme
  edges, and component composition with exact source locations;
  `Symfony: Analyze Twig Template Usages…` provides the editor surface.
- The plugin's Twig component collector is implemented as a structured
  language-server analytics request that aggregates attribute, service,
  compiled-container, and anonymous-template declarations by canonical name.
  Results include templates, typed/live/writable props, computed values,
  blocks, usages, exact source locations, and ready-to-use
  HTML/function/composition syntax; `Symfony: Browse Twig Components…`
  provides the editor surface.
- The plugin's Twig template-variable collector is implemented as a structured
  language-server analytics request with comma-separated logical names,
  project-relative paths, and Ant-style target-file globs. It merges controller
  render contexts, inherited input contracts, native `@var` annotations,
  globals, and component props, then returns canonical PHP types, provenance,
  and exact first-level Twig-accessible property/getter/method declarations;
  `Symfony: Analyze Twig Template Variables…` provides the editor surface.
- Controller/template/route—including persistent Twig `controller()` usages—
  form-type, Doctrine model/mapping, and DI decorator/parent/prototype code
  lenses, plus PHP class-to-service and effective-autowire constructor lenses,
  PHP/YAML Symfony configuration root/resource lenses, and YAML/XML/PHP
  routing-resource lenses are implemented as portable equivalents for IntelliJ
  related-item gutter markers. Symfony Endpoints are mapped to enriched route
  workspace symbols and inline PHP/YAML/XML method/path lenses that navigate to
  direct, service, or invokable controllers. Unambiguous Twig templates,
  routing imports, Symfony configuration resources, and configuration-root
  declarations also expose native clickable document links; multi-target and
  globbed references remain on definition/code-lens pickers. Add remaining
  high-value gutter targets.
- Inlay hints for resolved XML/YAML service arguments, clickable YAML/XML/PHP
  route controllers—including service aliases and invokable controllers—and
  clickable Twig-variable catalogs with typed member navigation plus
  print/conditional/collection-loop insertion.
- Related-file navigation between controllers, templates, routes, form types,
  and Doctrine models/mappings is implemented.

IDE-only profiler panels, settings UI, and terminal integration are out of the
language-server core. The plugin's project-tree file generators are exposed
through one portable, version-aware scaffold command and thin editor-extension
prompts; contextual generators remain code actions where source position is
part of their semantics.
